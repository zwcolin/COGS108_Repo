# COGS 108 Fall 2021 Project
#### Authors: Colin Wang, Weiyue Li, Luning Yang, Yuru Zhou

- Since our datasets are all based on Kaggle. Please prepare your `kaggle.json` which includes your kaggle user name and API key, and store that file under the root directory of this project. Information on getting `kaggle.json` can be found [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). After you have that file. You can just open our project and it will (semi) automatically install all required packages to run the project and prepare the dataset.

- Many visualizations under Exploratory Data Analysis part are based on animations. It's strongly recommended to run the entire notebook and see these visualizations. Otherwise, you may find *.gif versions of the same visualizations under the `visualizations` folder. If some visualizations do not display inside the notebook, **try restarting the kernel and run each cell one-by-one manually**.

- Some of our markdown formatting are done with the help of html encodings; however, these encodings won't properly show if you directly view the notebook on GitHub. Again, we strongly recommend you to open the notebook using Jupyter for best viewing conditions.
